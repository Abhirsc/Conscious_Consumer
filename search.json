    "text": "📝 Personal Experience\nI’ve been a Bambies customer for over three years and have owned three pairs:\n1. Daintree – my absolute favorite. I loved the feel, the look, and the vibe. Sadly, I lost it in Brisbane’s Mowbray Park.\n2. Another pair I ordered had a small defect, but Bambies replaced it efficiently and without fuss. Their customer service really shines.\n3. My current pair? Loving it again. Still fits perfectly, lightweight, and draws compliments.\nAs someone who values sustainable design, good craftsmanship, and honest service — I keep coming back."
